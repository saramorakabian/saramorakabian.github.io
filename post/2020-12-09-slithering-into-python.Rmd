#Breaking Up with R
I started learning the basics of Python in the last unit of my computational biology course and laughed because I could not comprehend the transiton after working with R for over a year. Little did my close-minded self know how cool Python and the available packages could be (I still love you R, but I think we should consider an open relationship). 

##R and Python; Two Apples From the Same Tree
Not only is Python is much more versatile and ranked number one amongst many programming languages, it lets me do everything I did in R! so I am glad I can translate the same information and learn even more useful tools in Python.
Here are some descriptive statistics computed base R compared with the same statistics computed in Python. The package Numpy (sounds like a Seasame Street Elephant with short legs) is an open-source numerical Python library used for working witrh arrays. 

###Finding the mean & median of earthquake magnitude and depth in base R
```{r}
quakes <- quakes

mean(quakes$mag)
median(quakes$mag)
mean(quakes$depth)
median(quakes$depth)

```

###Finding the mean & median of earthquake magnitude and depth with Numpy
```{python}
import pandas as pd
quakes=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/quakes.csv",index_col=0)

import numpy as np
np.mean(quakes.mag)
np.median(quakes.mag)
np.mean(quakes.depth)
np.median(quakes.depth)
```

There you go! Look at that. Maybe you can use R on casual Tuesdays and Python on date night. They're both great for data analysis. The cs world torments me becuase I know Python is the way to go for versatility, in the end. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```
