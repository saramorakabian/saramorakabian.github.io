#I started learning the basics of Python in the last unit of my computational biology course and laughed because I could not comprehend the transiton after working with R for over a year. Little did my close-minded self know how cool Python could be (I still love you R, but I think we should consider an open relationship). 

#Here is some base python I've learned to use! Numpy (the name of a package that sounds like a Seasame Street Elephant with short legs), a numerical Python library, is great for array indexing!


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```
