#A Tale of Two

Should lovers who speak different languages be forced to never communicate and reach their truest potential as partners? No! #lovealwayswins
Should two different languages never be able to exchange data? I think you know the answer to this question, homeslice.
Here's how it goes.

##Easy, Breezy, Cover Squirrel
First, R needs to have the library to exchange the flowers(data) he wants to give to Python.
```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

Then, R will define his offering (the information you want Python to read)
```{r}
C10H12N2O <- "seratonin"
"This is all of my love in a material offering, ilysm" <- C10H12N2O
brightredroses <- "This is all of my love in a material offering, ilysm"
```


So anything you defined in R, you can grab anything with "r." and follow up with what you want to grab after the ".". Python will now accept her roses!
```{python}
print(r.brightredroses)
```

Isn't young love beautiful?
